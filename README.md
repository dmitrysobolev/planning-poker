## Planning Poker for Agile Teams

This repository hosts a collaborative Planning Poker web app built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The tool lets product teams estimate work together in real time:

- Spin up lightweight rooms for each estimation session.
- Invite others with a shareable `/join` link; each participant keeps their identity in-browser.
- Choose between Fibonacci and T‑Shirt sizing decks.
- Pick cards privately, then mark yourself “Ready.” Votes reveal automatically when everyone is ready, or a facilitator can reveal/reset manually.
- Round resets, strategy changes, and departures update instantly for every client (polled every 3 seconds).

State is stored in-process for simplicity—great for demos and small teams. For production you’d back it with a shared datastore (Redis, Postgres, etc.) so rooms survive restarts and multiple server instances.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Deploying on Cloudflare Pages/Workers

The app runs entirely on the Edge runtime. Cloudflare expects a worker bundle plus static assets generated by `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`. Our build pipeline produces the layout automatically:

1. Build the project (the `postbuild` script invokes the adapter with `--skip-build`):

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

   The worker lands in `.vercel/output/static/_worker.js/index.js`; static assets are in `.vercel/output/static`.

2. Deploy with Wrangler (locally or in CI) using the provided script:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:cf
   ```

   In a Cloudflare Pages project, set the build command to `npm install && npm run build` and keep the paths above when invoking `wrangler deploy`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
